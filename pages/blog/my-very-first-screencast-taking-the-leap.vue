        <BlogPost :title="title" :postDate="postDate">
          <p>I am a self-taught front-end developer. I owe a large portion of what I know to some incredible individuals who took the time to create video tutorials — paid or free — and make them available to the world.</p>
          <p>Before working in front-end, I was a primary school teacher. I always loved teaching, and still very much enjoy doing code mentoring with colleagues and clients.</p>
          <p>I also always enjoyed video editing. </p>
          <p>Over the past near decade, I’ve been cutting clips of <strong>travel / family stuff</strong> on my <a href="http://youtube.com/simonswiss" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal Youtube account</a>, but never anything web-development related.</p>
          <h3>Doing something about it</h3>
          <p>I always had it in the back of my mind. I also always had that fear of not bringing anything new that most of us have when it comes to submitting a talk, a blog post or… video tutorials!</p>
          <p>English is also not my mother language. I am very fluent, but it still adds a level of insecurity to put yourself out there in a foreign language.</p>
          <p>Last New Year’s Eve, I came up with a simple resolution: start doing a video series on <strong>something</strong> in 2016.</p>
          <p>Fast forward a third of the year — and here I was, still thinking about doing it, but <strong>not actually doing anything</strong>. There is always too much work, too much to learn in the JavaScript churn.. always an excuse to push back.</p>
          <h3>Getting pro-active</h3>
          <p>On the 1st of May, I did what I should have done much earlier: become pro-active. I ordered a decent microphone — the Blue Yeti, more on that later — which would sit on my desk and make me feel stupid for not making any use of it.</p>
          <p>A few minutes after ordering the mic, I got really excited and started writing down the scripts for the first few videos of my first series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqCs1pdmf9o&amp;list=PLHrxuCR-0CcSWiMuLf58iuIsNlP549-Sk">Jade/Pug Tips in 90 Seconds</a>. The simple fact that I knew I now had invested in this mic instantly made me get the ball rolling.</p>
          <h3>A mental shift</h3>
          <p>Most importantly — I had a mental shift about the fear of doing things. Yes, there are other screencasts about Jade out there. Yes, some may be more advanced.</p>
          <p>The fact is: <strong>I don’t care</strong>. I am doing my own things, and bringing my own contribution to the wonderful web development community. I feel good about it — and take pride in trying to produce some high quality material.</p>
          <h3>My first steps</h3>
          <p>A few days later, my Blue Yeti arrived from the post. It is bigger and heavier than I expected. The resistance and <em>clickity-ness</em> of the metal knobs give a very high-end, pro feel about this device.</p>
          <p>Minutes after the unboxing, I was already recording my first video. I was blown away by the sound quality (in my monitoring headphones, that is) and record the first video clip in a couple of takes.</p>
          <p>What I somewhat expected, but thought would be a non-factor because of the crisp monitoring sound, was the following: recording audio in a large, square room without carpet or curtains is <strong>not a good idea</strong>. The echo is nasty.</p>
          <p>Here is the intro video in question. I’ll let you be the judge on the amount of echo in my voice. You can also tell it’s my first screencast ever. I have stage fright, even if I’m alone in my home office.</p>            
          <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
          <div class="embed-container my-4"><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQmjATWJhfQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>            
          <p>Despite the average audio quality — I am happy with this first video.</p>
          <p><strong>I have done it.</strong></p>
          <p>My first bit of screencast material is out there on youtube. It announces a full series coming up — which again pro-actively makes me commit to deliver.</p>
          <p>I am currently committing to deliver to a whopping Youtube follower base of … <strong>two users</strong>. but still! &#x1f602;</p>
          <h3>A questionable DYI Recording Booth</h3>
          <p>Following the poor audio quality on the first video, I went ahead and googled some DYI soundproofing / echo killing tips, and spoke to some great people in a few Slack channels.</p>
          <p>I also remember from my audio engineering 6-month certificate at SAE, 15 years ago, that fabric sucks up a lot of echo and a wardrobe is therefore a cool place to hide and record some sneaky audio clips.</p>
          <p>I don’t have a proper wardrobe anymore, but I got a mean towel rack that, enhanced with my two winter hoodies, made for a pretty good, slightly random recording studio.</p>
          <p>Here’s what it looked like. Yes, I zipped the two hoodies together to the top and ducked my head under there.</p>
          <div class="my-4">
            <img
            src="~/assets/img/wardrobe-booth.jpg"
            class="shadow rounded-sm mb-1"
            sizes="100vw"
            srcset="~/assets/img/wardrobe-booth.jpg 400w"
            alt="Wardrobe booth"
            >
            <p class="text-sm text-grey italic">The dodgy, &quot;don&#039;t try this at home&quot; recording booth.</p>
          </div>
                        
          <p>I received some good feedback on this setup, and some people shared similar stories of coming up with random pillows / curtains / clothes to scare the echo away.</p>
          <h3>It most definitely worked</h3>
          <p>All I can say is the effort was well worth it. In about 5 minutes of intense engineering and with a budget of zero dollars, I brought a significant improvement to the audio quality of my recordings.</p>
          <p>If you watched the first video, you should hear a clear difference in this one. I also noticed <strong>my stage fright voice going away</strong> within the first 5 seconds of talking, and I was then much more comfortable. Must be getting some experience!</p>
          <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
          <div class="embed-container my-4"><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMzlaQD_7Yw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>            
          <p>That’s much better, <em>right</em>?</p>
          <p>A few minutes later, I had video #3 uploaded.</p>            
          <style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
          <div class="embed-container my-4"><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnGzxgBzWEY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            
          <p>That’s it for now. I will wait for my pop filter to arrive early next week before continuing with the series.</p>
          <h3>The bottom line</h3>
          <p>So, why am I telling you all this? To be honest, I am not quite sure. All I know is I am really happy to have finally starting doing the series. I didn’t achieve that much so far and haven’t even really started talking about Jade/Pug.</p>
          <p>But, and this is the key here, I have put myself out there and produced something. I have <strong>stopped talking about it and have actually started doing it</strong>.</p>
          <h3>Take the leap</h3>
          <p>Each one of us, in web development or any other field, have some ideas / challenges in our mind. We tend to make up excuses, consciously or not, that give good reasons not to do it right now.</p>
          <p>I challenge you, dear reader, to do it. Whatever it is that is brewing inside you. That thing you think about sometimes, but never get to actually make it happen.</p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p><strong>I challenge you to take the leap</strong>.</p>
